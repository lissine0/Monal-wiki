Since December Apple require develpers to provide information of the data information used and may collected by apps to the users in the App Store:

> Later this year, the App Store will help users understand an app’s privacy practices before they download the app on any Apple platform. On each app’s product page, users can learn about some of the data types the app may collect, and whether that data is linked to them or used to track them. You’ll need to provide information about your app’s privacy practices, including the practices of third-party partners whose code you integrate into your app, in App Store Connect. This information will be required to submit new apps and app updates to the App Store starting December 8, 2020.

Before providing the necessary information we would like to make a general statement to the Monal users: 
- Fewest external libraires
- In-depth and picky dealing with data and the data processed
- A general mindset of no or fewest data is best.

Data collection
> “Collect” refers to transmitting data off the device in a way that allows you and/or your third-party partners to access it for a period longer than what is necessary to service the transmitted request in real time.

> “Third-party partners” refers to analytics tools, advertising networks, third-party SDKs, or other external vendors whose code you’ve added to your app.
