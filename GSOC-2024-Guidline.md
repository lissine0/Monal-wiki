# Prerequisites 
0. Read the [GSOC 2024 xmpp wiki page](https://wiki.xmpp.org/web/Google_Summer_of_Code_2024) as well as the official GSOC 2024 guidlines by Google _**thoroughly**_
1. Create an XMPP account
2. Join our public support channel under [monal@chat.yax.im](xmpp:monal@chat.yax.im?join)
3. Create a github account
3. Add my private xmpp contact at [thilo.molitor@juforum.de](xmpp:thilo.molitor@juforum.de)
4. Send me your github name in the private chat

# Selecting a Teaser Task
1. Everyone should at least complete 2 of the [Short GSOC Teaser Tasks](https://github.com/monal-im/Monal/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22Short+GSOC+Teaser%22)
2. Everyone should at least complete one [GSOC Teaser Task](https://github.com/monal-im/Monal/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22%F0%9F%8E%83+GSOC+Teaser%22)
3. To get assigned to a task, write a comment in the corresponding github issue
4. If you want to complete some issue that's not labeled as GSOC Teaser, just go ahead and write a comment in that issue. I will estimate it's size and assign an appropriate label afterwards (`Short GSOC Teaser` or `GSOC Teaser`)

# Apply for a GSOC Task listed in the XMPP wiki
To apply for this task **after completing the above teaser task requirements** just send a message to the public support channel linked above.

If not already present, I will create an issue for the task, assign you and we can discuss everything related to the task in this github issue (or, for quick questions, via 1:1 chat).
