- Session timeout:
  - Due to its push notification design, Monal has the tendency to login or resume rather a lot. Therefore it would be good to **increase the session timeout** to at least **an hour**
  - **Increase** the allowed successful **logins per timeslot**
  - Use **valid** and **signed certs**!
  - **Publish SRV records** and **prefer TLS over StartTLS** to reduce round trip times. This is important on slow or unreliable mobile networks and improves the user experience and push notification reliability
